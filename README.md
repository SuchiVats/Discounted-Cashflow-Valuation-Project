# Discounted Cash Flow Model Project

## Project Overview
This project applies the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to estimate the valuation of a company using its financial data. It involves forecasting future cash flows, calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), determining the terminal value, and discounting the projected cash flows and terminal value to present value. Additionally, the project answers key questions related to financial statements and valuation metrics.

## Steps Involved
1. **Forecasting Cash Flows**: Project free cash flows by developing revenue projections, a fixed assets schedule, and a net working capital projection.
2. **WACC Computation**: Calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to discount all future cash flows to present value.
3. **Terminal Value Calculation**: Compute the terminal value, representing the company's worth beyond the forecast period.
4. **Enterprise Value Calculation**: Discount both the terminal value and the forecasted free cash flows to ascertain the enterprise value and company valuation.

## Questions we can answer after this project
1. What factors can affect the composition of a company's current assets vs long-term assets?
2. How can a company's debt-to-equity ratio impact its creditworthiness and access to capital?
3. How has the debt-to-equity ratio changed over the four years? Is the company relying more on debt financing or equity financing?
4. How has the company's total revenue grown over the three years? What segments are driving this growth (merchandise sales, membership fees)?
5. Calculate and compare the gross margin across the three years. Is the company able to maintain or improve its margins?
6. How can investors utilize free cash flow analysis to compare different companies in the same industry?
